Saves all form data as a user enters it. Supports multiple forms and persists between sessions. 

To use simply add a unique id (this gets used as an identifier for the db) to your `<form>` tag e.g `<form id="mycontactform">`

Currently supports:

`<input type="text">`

`<input type="radio">`

`<input type="checkbox">`

`<textarea>`

`<select>`

Have fun. Thank you drive through.
